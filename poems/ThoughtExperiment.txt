Perhaps it has been overstated 
That the day's events are purely fated. 
And too it has been understated
That you can live the day 'til you're sated. 

The day's events are not purely fated,  
Though the contrary has been overstated. 
You should live the day 'til you're sated
But this imperative oft is understated.
