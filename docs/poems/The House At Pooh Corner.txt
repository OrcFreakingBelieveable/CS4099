I lay on my chest
And I thought it best
To pretend I was having an evening rest;

I lay on my tum
And I tried to hum
But nothing particular seemed to come.

My face was flat
On the floor, and that
Is all very well for an acrobat;

But it doesn't seem fair
To a Friendly Bear
To stiffen him out with a basket-chair

And a sort of sqoze
Which grows and grows
Is not too nice for his poor old nose,

And a sort of squch
Is much too much
For his neck and his mouth and his ears and such.
