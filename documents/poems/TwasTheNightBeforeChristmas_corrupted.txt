'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the home 
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;
The stockings were hung by the chimney with caution
In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there;

The children were nestled all snug in their beds,
While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads;
And mamma in her kerchief, and I in my hat,
Had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap,

When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,
I sprang from the bed to see what was the issue.
Away to the window I flew like a flare,
Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.

The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow
Gave the lustre of mid-day to objects beneath,
When, what to my wondering eyes should come along,
But a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny reindeer,

With a little old driver, so lively and fast,
I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick.
More rapid than eagles his coursers they arrived,
And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name:

"Now, Dasher! now, Dancer! now, Prancer and Vixen!
On, Comet! on, Cupid! on, Donder and Blitzen!
To the top of the porch! to the top of the rampart!
Now dash away! dash away! dash away all!"
