Sunday morning
I'm not gonna lie
I'm pretty hungover
And I'm scat and I'm dry

I'm sitting with the family
In a boujee café
Why did I drop four caps
Before Mother's day?

The waitress says "I'm Patricia
Can I get you a drink?"
Hey Patricia, can you bring me
The kitchen sink? So I can drown myself
In front of all your clientele
I've done bad things to my body
Now I'm going through hell

Mum says
"Tom's such a funny boy!"
My sister says
"Don't you fucking ruin Mother's day again"

I heard what they said
But I couldn't care less
I just saw this café does a
A big breakfast

Big, big, big
Big, big, big
Big breakfast

I'm gonna regret ordering the
Big breakfast
Everybody seems to forget how they felt last time
They got the big breakfast

I think that I'm still drunk
It's the only thing getting me out of this funk

Patricia
Daddy want the big breakfast

Wednesday arvo
Work's set up an embargo
On me going home
To watch Netflix and cry

Boss says
"Hey, we've had a long day
Why don't we have the next meeting
Down in the café?"

Whatever you want
You know it's boss man's shout
But nothing too pricey
Don't get the trout!

Ha ha ha ha ha fuck you

I'm gonna get the most expensive thing on the menu
What do they got?
Oh, they do an all-day breakfast here
Shit

Eggs
Bacon
Hashed brown
Baked beans
Another hashed brown
Sausage
Toast
Regret

I'm gonna regret ordering the
Big breakfast
Everybody seems to forget how they felt last time
They got the big breakfast

Don't you talk to me
About my health
I just want a breakfast
That makes me hate myself

And that's why
I'm gonna get the big breakfast
I'm gonna get the big breakfast
I'm gonna get the big breakfast
